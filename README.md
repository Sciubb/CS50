# CS50
Repository for course
This folder contains my final project for the Web Development course in CS50 Law.
The assignment required building a webpage. This wepage can be run by clicking index.html.
My webpage offers Lionel Trains which I have for sale.
I have included picture of same/or similar items that I have for sale.
There in also links to the internet where the user can look-up the train items for himself.
I've also included a .pdf spreadsheet of all my Lione; products.
